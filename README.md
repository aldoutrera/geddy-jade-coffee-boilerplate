=============================

A GeedyJS jade coffee boilerplate to kickstart projects

So yeah, I really liked GeddyJs, I'm crazy for Coffe-Script and Jade, so I made this boilerplate
to kickstart prototypes or productions apps.

It's pretty much a common geddy generated app with the --jade flag and the default js files
translated to coffee.

Requirements

- nodejs
- npm
- Geddy installed globally

Installation

- Download this repo
- cd to the folder
- npm install
- geddy
- build something awesome (not optional)

I hope you'll find it useful
